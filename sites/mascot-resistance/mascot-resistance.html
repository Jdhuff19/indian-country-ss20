         <h3>Appropriation NOT appreciation</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Cultural appropriation comes in many forms. We see this in the clothes that people wear to the way that they talk. In terms of the cultural appropriation, sports teams across the United States have repeatedly exploited Indigenous traditions as well as exploit and deface the Indian community with imaging and names that are seen as extremely derogatory towards this large group of people. The Oneida Indian Nation is a federally recognized tribe located and headquartered in upstate New York where they have been since long before European colonialism. Making their mark in American history, the Oneida Indian Nation became the first ally to America when they joined the colonists in their fight for independence during the American Revolutionary War. In 1794, after the victory over the British and many hardships for the Oneidas, George Washington signed the Treaty of Canandaigua recognizing the Oneida Nation as a sovereign entity. While historically being a major catalyst in history, the Oneida have also been a primary push for the Change the Mascot campaign against the Washington R******s and their entire organization. The Oneida launched the Change the Mascot campaign as a grassroots campaign that aims to garner both attention as well as provide information to people about the damaging effects of teams like Washington that are ignorant to the reasoning’s behind wanting the name changed. From protests to campaigns that involve radio and TV commercials, Oneida along with other tribes and activists have used their voice and means to make this issue no longer an issue and bring an end to the blatant disrespect towards their group of people.</p>

     <h3>Local Efforts from the Oneida</h3>
     <p>The Oneida Indian Nation along with several other tribes across the U.S. have been trying to draw both attention and education towards the use of theR-word and other deragatory terms/names for Natives. Back in 2013 within the home state of the Oneida, a school in Cooperstown, NY voted to change the high schools team mascot from the R-word to the Cooperstown Hawkeyes. While hundred of schools across the country have elected for new mascots and logos, what really drew the attention of the Oneida was the fact that the schools student body drew the vote for the school board. In other words, the students as a collective whole decided and recognized that R******s is indeed a term that does not describe Indigenous people and thus had the will power to have the name changed. This moved and captured the Oneida so much so that they donated $10,000 to the school to purchase new football team jersey. In that same year, the both Washington team owner Dan Snyder and NFL commisioner Roger Goodell recieved a letter from members of congress, whom were also co-chairs of the Congressional Native American Caucus, asking them to consider changing the name out of respect for the country’s native people. Congress introduced a bill that would amend the 1946 Trademark Act and cancel any trademark that used the “R-word”. Mr. Goodell eventually made an announcement regarding the controversy stating that teams and owners "need to be listening". During this time in 2013, the Oneida had just released their first commericals targeting the name/mascot change.</p>

             <h3>Locally to Nationally</h3>
     <p> When the Oneida intially released their first set of commercials and radio ads, the Oneida and the Change the Mascot campaign were coinciding their releases with gamedays for Washington. A Youtube channel by the name of TheOneida is a channel that offers content that promotes language, development in communities, and many forums done by the campaign with guests speaking on the issues of the R-Word. In a symposium held on October 7, 2013 in Washington, DC Ray Halbritter, the Oneida Nation Representative states in his opening remarks </p>
      <blockquote> "No matter the history of something, if it is offending people then it is time to change it and this is a great time to do it. Regardless of the history. Regardless of its legacy. It is offensive. It is a dictionary defined offensive term." </blockquote>
      <p> Halbritter goes on to mention how football is supposed to be a unifying thing but yet the use of a racial slur is not a unifying force but instead a divisive epithet. The Hon Elaeanor Holmes Norton, a judge in the Washington DC area spoke during the symposium as well and related the historical context of the racial slur 'n***a'. In a city that is composed of a large population of minorites, she points to how the uprising of individuals occurs when a word that is historically against black people is used and how it makes one feel. The excuses of a 'term of endearment' and an 'appreciation' for ones culture is downright ingorance. What Hon. Norton is trying to paint along with Ray is that these terms that have been historically defined as blatant and straightforward racism need to be recognized as such. The Oneida releasing their commericals and radio ads during this time launched the conversation of how little the team will be effected. The team is still the team. If anything, one can argue that the team will grow stronger as the unifying force Halbritter stated will actually be just that. </p>

             <h3>Historical Components</h3> <p></p>
    <p>So what exactly does the R-word mean? Where did it come from? Has it always been a negative identifier for Native people? History books and journals trace the word back to being used to the 1700's in reference to the Beothuk tribe out of Newfoundland in Canada. The Beothuk's would use red ochre paint on their bodies as a form of expression and culture but eventually led white European settlers to denote these people as 'Red men'. Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian historian, stated that initially the R-word was used as a way to identify the Natives from the colonists. The term was used during negotiations as well as in daily life from both sides. As time went on from the 1760's when it was used as a misinformed identifier, it began taking on the negative connotation that we know now. It became something that whites would use widespread in novels as well as movies (which goes into other deragatory imaging and vocabulary towards Natives such as savages). The Wizard of Oz writer, L. Frank Baum, even wrote several pieces of work that celebrated deaths of major chiefs and nobles within the Native American community such as Sitting Bull (1831-1890) and the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890). In one of his editorials written in 1890 after Sitting Bull's death and the massacre, he states "With his (Sitting Bull) fall the nobility of the R******s is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them." The violence he continues on with calling for the annihalation of these R-words as well as the growing popularity at this time of sports teams using these terms, the word arrived at the disparaging, offensive definition we know and fight today. This was a small piece to a big puzzle of using  </p>

    <h3>Exploitation at its Finest </h3>
    <p> At the heightened popularity of deragatory terms being used as sports names, the campaigning and divide from the sports world and the Indian community bridged farther and farther. Baseball teams such as the Cleveland Indians, basketball teams like Golden State Warriors, and even our local team of the Central Michigan Chippewas have benefited and profitted off of the exploitation of the Indian Community and most famously, the lawsuit against the Washington team. Dan Scott, the president of the Washington team has said on multiple occasions that he will not change the name nor does he see a problem with the name. Seen within the film 'More Than A Word' we see the continued exploitation of using community nobles and elders to paint this picture that it is a select few that seem to be against this issue.

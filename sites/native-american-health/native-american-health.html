		 <h3>Who</h3>
   <p>The Indigenous People who reside in modern day Alaska are of Athabascan, Tsimpsian, Tlingit, Haida, Eskimo and Aleut descent. I am directing my research findings for my case study on people of Eskimo and Aleut descent who are located in Southern Alaska.</p>

         <h3>Is Diabetes a Genetic Predisposition?</h3>
<p>Diabetes is the result of too much sugar in ones blood stream. Diabetes has become an epidemic affecting a majority of Indigenous Peoples. With the rate of Diabetes being as high as it is, the question is, is Diabetes a genetic predisposition? That is, are Alaska Natives liable to suffer from Diabetes under the influence of environmental conditions? Unlike some traits, diabetes seem to be inherited from a complicated rather than simple pattern. Yet clearly, some people are born more likely to develop diabetes than others.
	Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its pancreatic beta cells. The rush of Type 1 Diabetes is attributed to both an inherited risk and external triggers. This can include diet or an infection. The search for the problem and solution to genetic and environmental risk factors are on going (ncbi). A majority of Type 1 diabetics are either overweight or obese. The Inherited factors are just as important but the genes involved remain poorly defined (ncbi).
	Type 2 Diabetes can in fact be hereditary. However, this does not mean that if your parents has (or had) Type 2 Diabetes, you are guaranteed to develop it. Instead, this just highlights the greater chance of developing Type 2 Diabetes (endocrine web). Genetic predisposition increases the chance of a disease repeating itself in offspring within a species or population. The research on both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes suggest that, you can inherit the risk.

<h3>Mental Health</h3>
<p>Mental health is commonly known to consist of a wide range of conditions that affect one's mood, thinking and behavior. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, a few years ago suicide was the second leading cause of death for American Indian/ Alaska Natives between the ages of 10 and 34. More research showed that they are 50% more likely to experience feelings of nervousness or restlessness in comparison to their non hispanic white counterparts.
Racial/ ethnic, gender and sexual minorities often suffer from poor mental health at the hands of inaccessibility of high quality mental health care services, cultural stigma surrounding mental health care, discrimination and overall lack of awareness about mental health. Research, gathered from the  Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), shows that the Behavioral Health Department works with Tribal health organizations throughout the state to help build the overall health of Alaskans and healthier communities. Furthermore, the American Psychiatric Association (APA), has data that indicates that Alaska Native populations have a shockingly  unbalanced rate of mental health concerns than the majority of the US population. Higher rates of substance use disorders, PTSD, suicide in Alaska Native communities have all been correlated to historical trauma that was forced upon them. The forced removal from their land, government operated schools in which they were prohibited from seeing their parents, spiritual practices and culture in general. Although the utilization rates for Alaska Natives are lower than most, there is probable cause for this. However, there is just reasoning for this. Low utilization is likely the result of a factors such as stigmatization of mental health, little to no culturally trained providers as well as a lack of available resources(i.e. community location). Low utilization is also the result of barriers to accessing mental health treatment. This is all but not limited to economic barriers, lack of awareness, associated stigmas, lack of cultural competence and lack of effective intervention strategies. </p>

<h3>Deprivation & Disempowerment</h3>
<p>Disparities in health have existed among Alaska native populations since the time of first contact. A lot of this is the result of demographic, social, health and health care disparities. Alaska Natives are exposed to trauma in various forms. According to “Anthropology and the American Indian/ Alaska Native Health Crisis”, the current epidemic of health problems in Alaska Native populations start with forced compliance. This is through hegemony both culturally and medically. As we know, hegemony is an influence over others through social, cultural, ideological or economic factors that are exerted by a dominant group. In short, power. Self- Determination Theory is “an approach to human motivation and personality that uses traditional empirical methods while employing an organismic metatheory that ‘highlights the importance of humans’ evolved inner resources for personality development and behavioral self-regulation. This theory completes a study on people’s tendencies to grow and their innate psychological needs that relates to their self-motivation and personality integration (Ryan, Kuhl, Deci, 2000). This theory recognizes and identifies 3 basic psychological needs in which they consider are universally required for humans to thrive (Ryan and Deci 2011). Autonomy, self government, competence, capability of doing something efficiently, and relatedness through a social connection are psychological needs that that all humans need in order to thrive in some manner. This study confirms that psychological health is at risk if any of the 3 needs are not met. In relation to this, when people lack autonomy they feel that they are being dominated by others. Both their mental and physical health deteriorates due to social, economic and or political circumstances. </p>
<h3>Taking Action: What Can Be Done?</h3>
<p>Traditional cultural practices</p>
    <h6>In a reading titled "Alaska Natives Use Ancient Traditions to Fight Mental Health Problems", Billy Charles (former mayor of Emmonak, southwestern Alaska) states that gathering together to hold hands a form a circle around the youth shelters them from evil. This practice is to communicate the value of children and being needed for the community. From a child's perspective, this provides a sense of purpose and being needed goes a long way.</h6>
<p>Collaborative work with the IHS to provide comprehensive health services to Alaska Natives (Eskimos, Aleuts).</p>
    <h6>In order to serve and fulfill their mission of raising the physical, mental, social and spiritual health of American Indians and Alaska Natives.</h6>
<p>Alaska Native administrated health centers</p>
    <h6> Creating a sense of identity and connectedness </h6>
<p>Majority (socially dominant) advocates</p>
    <h6>Those with social, political and economic power </h6>

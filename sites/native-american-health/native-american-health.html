         <h3>Who</h3>

		 <p>The Indigenous People who reside in modern day Alaska are of Athabascan, Tsimpsian, Tlingit, Haida, Eskimo and Aleut descent. I am directing my research findings for my case study on people of Eskimo and Aleut descent who are located in Southern Alaska.</p>

         <h3>Is Diabetes a Genetic Predisposition?</h3>
<p>Diabetes is the result of too much sugar in ones blood stream. Genetic predisposition increases the chance of a disease repeating itself in offspring within a species or population. In relation to my case study, diabetes has become an epidemic affecting the majority of Indigenous Peoples. At a glance, some of the several risk factors related to diabetes include obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and even cigarette smoking.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mental Health</h3>
<p>Mental health is commonly known to consist of a wide range of conditions that affect one's mood, thinking and behavior. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, a few years ago suicide was the second leading cause of death for American Indian/ Alaska Natives between the ages of 10 and 34. More research showed that they are 50% more likely to experience feelings of nervousness or restlessness in comparison to their non hispanic white counterparts.
 </p>
<br>
<h3>Deprivation & Disempowerment</h3>
<p>Disparities in health have existed among Alaska Native populations since the time of first contact. A lot of this is the result of demographic, social, health and health care disparities. Alaska Natives are exposed to trauma in various forms. According to “Anthropology and the American Indian/ Alaska Native Health Crisis”, the foundations of the current epidemic of health problems in American Indian and Alaska Native populations start with forced compliance. This is done through medical and cultural hegemony(Taylor). As we know, hegemony  is an influence over others through social, cultural, ideological or economic factors that are exerted by a dominant group. Self- Determination Theory is “an approach to human motivation and personality that uses traditional empirical methods while employing an organismic metatheory that ‘highlights the importance of humans’ evolved inner resources for personality development and behavioral self-regulation” (Ryan, Kuhl, Deci, 68). This theory does a study on people’s tendencies to grow  and their innate psychological needs that relates to their self-motivation and personality integration (Ryan, Kuhl, Deci, 68).</p>
<h3>Taking Action</h3>
<p>Taking control</p>
<p>Collaborative work with  the IHS to provide comprehensive health services to Alaska Natives (Eskimos, Aleuts).</p>
<p>Alaska Native administrated health centers</p>
<p>Traditional cultural practices, cultural sensitivity</p>
<p>Majority (socially dominant) advocates</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>The Aleut Region in Alaska is home to the Aleut.  There are mental health disparities that have become a contemporary part of their culture. In looking broadly at the issues, it can be seen that PTSD is part of the explanatory model that then sheds light on such issues as alchoholism in the older generations and now includes substance abuse within the younger generations.</p>

       <h2>History and Culture</h2
         <p>The earliest settlers, now known as the Paleo-Aleuts, arrived in the region now known as the Aleutian Islands around 4,000 years ago.  Russian fur traders gave the name Aleut to the Unanganin people.  This traditional name means “original people”.  The Aleut are culturally and linguistically related to the Inuit Eskimo. The Aleut population was estimated to have an inclusive population of around 25,000 prior to colonial contact.  Their population dropped to a low of 2,000 after disease decimated their population. By the 1990 Census, the population was a reported 11,941 with approximately 17,000 people identifying with Aleut ancestry (Alaskan Natives, 2020).  In 1741, the Russian government sent Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov to explore the Alaskan coast, and they claimed the territory for Russia and eventually sold the territory that now comprises Alaska to the United States in 1867 (Henson, 2008).  In the 1820s, the Russian-American Company resettled many of the Aleut families from the broader region to the Commander and Pribilof Islands, where Aleut communities continue to reside (Alaskan Natives, 2020).  Although few Russian actually settled in Alaska, those who did had a considerable impact on the indigenous peoples they encountered (Henson, 2008).  By, 1910, the Russian presence, though few in numbers, resulted in few full-blooded Aleut remaining. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA) saw the beginning of the Aleut Corporation.  At the inception, only about 2,000 enrollees could prove the ¼ blood quantum (Alaskan Natives, 2020).</p>
